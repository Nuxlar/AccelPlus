# Accel Plus

Ever wonder why MUL-T and Artificer feel so painful movement-wise? They have lower acceleration than other survivors, this mod changes their acceleration to be consistent with the other survivors. False Son also has lower acceleration but not as low as MUL-T and Artificer.

Raises acceleration from 30 -> 80 for MUL-T/Artificer and 50 -> 80 for False Son.
